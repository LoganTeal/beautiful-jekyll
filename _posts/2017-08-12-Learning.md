I **love to learn**.  Learning has actually een bone of my Top 5 Strengths according to [StrengthsFinder](http://www.strengthsfinder.com/home.aspx) the past two times I have taken it.

Having graduated with my MS in Analytics this past May, I   Right now I am focusing on a few different resources to further my education and skills.  I have broken down by resources into four different mediums: MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), Podcasts, Projects, and Written Resources (ie. everything else).  One problem that I often have when it comes to this is having an abudant source of knowledge at your fingertips. 

### Online Courses
I have found online courses to be extremely useful for the Data Science area.  There are *tons* of different websites offering detailed courses on relevant topics.  

    One of my favorite resources is Udemy.  Right now I am working on [R Programming: Advanced Analytics for Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/r-analytics/learn/v4/t/lecture/5192740?start=0).  This course is taugh by Kirill Eremenko who also has one of my favorite podcasts I mention below.

Another great resource for online courses is [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).  There are many great courses here taught through well known Univeresities.  You can sign up to enroll the course where you get access to graded material and recieve a certification.  You can also audit the course for free, which just gives you access to the course materials.
  
### Podcasts
Whenever I workout I prefer to listen to podcasts than music.  I can easily focus on a podcast and the miles fly by on a run.  I have a few favorite data science podcasts that I have reccomend to people in this space:
* [SuperDataScience](https://soundcloud.com/superdatascience)  Kirill interviews guests ranging from aspiring data scientists to thought leaders in the community. 
* [Linear Digressions](http://lineardigressions.com/) Ben and Katie do a great job at diving into technical topics and explaining them in a non-techinal way.
* [Data Skeptics](https://dataskeptic.com/podcast) Mini Episodes of DS, Machine Learning, and AI.

### Projects
This portion I have yet to really begin to crack down on - but it is one of my goals.  I will be working on a Kaggle competition in the near future and will be posting my progress on this blog.  I think that Kaggle projects offer a way to dive straight into some of the predictive analytics that I am interested in, and a great way to learn from others by looking at code and progress.

### Books/Articles/Websites/Blogs
Open up LinkedIn and I am sure your feed is full of people posting, commenting and liking a wide variety of articles.  I try and identify one relevant to my interests and career and browse through them.  A few of the other sources that I like to read articles from are
What I am Reading Now:

      Small Data, gifted to me by my good friend Sylvie Brick, explores the importance of the details we often disregard in a big data focused world
  * [R for Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund
