Having graduated with my MS in Analytics this past May, I   Right now I am focusing on a few different resources to further my education and skills.  I have broken down by resources into four different mediums: MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), Podcasts, Projects, and Written Resources (ie. everything else).  One problem that I often have when it comes to this is having an abudant source of knowledge at your fingertips. 

**Online Courses**
I have found online courses to be extremely useful for the Data Science area.  There are *tons* of different websites offering courses in all types of niche areas.  taken a few courses by Kirill before, including the predecessor of the one I am currently working on
  
**Podcasts**
Whenever I workout I prefer to listen to podcasts than music.  I can easily focus on a podcast and the miles fly by on a run.  I have a few favorite data science podcasts that I have reccomend to people in this space:
* (SuperDataScience)[https://soundcloud.com/superdatascience]  Kirill interviews guests ranging from aspiring data scientists to thought leaders in the community. 
* (Linear Digressions)[http://lineardigressions.com/] Ben and Katie do a great job at diving into technical topics and explaining them in a non-techinal way.
* (Data Skeptics)[https://dataskeptic.com/podcast] Mini Episodes of DS, Machine Learning, and AI.

**Projects**
This portion I have yet to really begin to crack down on - but it is one of my goals.  I will be working on a Kaggle competition in the near future and will be posting my progress on this blog.  I think that Kaggle projects offer a way to dive straight into some of the predictive analytics that I am interested in, and a great way to learn from others by looking at code and progress.

**Books/Articles/Websites/Blogs**
Open up LinkedIn and I am sure your feed is full of people posting, commenting and liking a wide variety of articles.  I try and identify one relevant to my interests and career and browse through them.  A few of the other sources that I like to read articles from are
What I am Reading Now:
  * (Small Data)[https://www.amazon.com/Small-DATA-Clues-Uncover-Trends/dp/1522635181] by Martin Lindstom
  * (R for Data Science)[https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399] by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund
