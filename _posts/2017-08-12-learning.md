I **love to learn**.  Learning has actually been one of my Top 5 Strengths according to [StrengthsFinder](http://www.strengthsfinder.com/home.aspx) the past two times I have taken it. Right now I am focusing on a few different resources to further my education and skills.  I have broken them down into four different mediums: Online Courses, Podcasts, Articles/Blogs, and Books.

### Online Courses
I have found online courses to be extremely useful for refining technical skills.  There are *tons* of different websites offering detailed courses on relevant topics.  

Right now I am working on [R Programming: Advanced Analytics for Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/r-analytics/learn/v4/t/lecture/5192740?start=0) on Udemy.  This course is taught by Kirill Eremenko who also has one of my favorite podcasts I mention later in the post.  This specific course focuses on data preparation, lists, and the apply function family.

Another great resource I have used for online courses is [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).  Coursera has many courses taught through well-known universities.  You can sign up to enroll the course where you get access to graded material and receive a certification, or you can audit the course for free and just receive the materials.
  
### Podcasts
Whenever I have a long drive or go for a workout, I enjoy listening to podcasts.  I have a few favorite data science podcasts that I have recommended to others:
* [SuperDataScience](https://soundcloud.com/superdatascience)  Kirill interviews guests ranging from aspiring data scientists to thought leaders in the community. 
* [Linear Digressions](http://lineardigressions.com/) Ben and Katie do a great job at diving into technical topics and explaining them in a non-technical way.
* [Data Skeptics](https://dataskeptic.com/podcast) Mini Episodes of DS, Machine Learning, and AI.

### Articles & Blogs
These resources are a great way to keep up with what's going on right now in the field.  A few of the sites that I like to browse are:
* [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/)
* [KDNuggets](http://www.kdnuggets.com/)
* [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)
* [O'Reilly - Data](https://www.oreilly.com/topics/data)

### Books
While most books can be found online as PDF's or on audiobook, I still prefer having a physical copy of something to read.  I find that I absorb the material better, plus I am a big highlighter. Here's what I am reading now:
  * [Small Data](https://www.amazon.com/Small-Data-Clues-Uncover-Trends/dp/1250080681/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1502595230&sr=1-1&keywords=small+data)
    + This was a gift to me from my good friend Sylvie Brick.  Small Data explores the importance of the details we often disregard in a 'big data' focused world, and how paying attention to those small details can make impactful differences.
  * [R for Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399)
    + This book teaches data science from a foundation built on the tidy data principles that Hadley Wickham created.  The Tidy Data principles being each column is a variable and each row an observation.  He has created many tools and packages in R to help users create tidy data.  There is also a [PDF version](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) of the book.
  * [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=RM7YQVRZ75BTFNX33TEP)
    + This textbook is a great resource for those wanting to use R for a wide variety of topics including supervised and unsupervised learning.  


These are some of the resources that I am using now as I continue to grow in the data science field.  I am curious how you pick up new skills and keep up with the changing landscape of data science. If you have any resources that you have found to be helpful please feel free to comment below!
