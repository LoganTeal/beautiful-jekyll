I **love to learn**.  Learning has actually een bone of my Top 5 Strengths according to [StrengthsFinder](http://www.strengthsfinder.com/home.aspx) the past two times I have taken it.

Having graduated with my MS in Analytics this past May, I   Right now I am focusing on a few different resources to further my education and skills.  I have broken down by resources into four different mediums: MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), Podcasts, Articles/Blogs, and Books.  One problem that I often have when it comes to this is having an abudant source of knowledge at your fingertips. 

### Online Courses
I have found online courses to be extremely useful for technical skills.  There are *tons* of different websites offering detailed courses on relevant topics.  

One of my favorite platforms is [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).  Right now I am working on [R Programming: Advanced Analytics for Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/r-analytics/learn/v4/t/lecture/5192740?start=0).  This course is taught by Kirill Eremenko who also has one of my favorite podcasts I mention below.

Another great resource for online courses is [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).  There are many great courses here taught through well known univeresities.  You can sign up to enroll the course where you get access to graded material and recieve a certification, or you can audit the course for free and just recieve the materials.
  
### Podcasts
Whenever I workout or commute I enjoy listening to podcasts.  I have a few favorite data science podcasts that I have reccomended to others:
* [SuperDataScience](https://soundcloud.com/superdatascience)  Kirill interviews guests ranging from aspiring data scientists to thought leaders in the community. 
* [Linear Digressions](http://lineardigressions.com/) Ben and Katie do a great job at diving into technical topics and explaining them in a non-techinal way.
* [Data Skeptics](https://dataskeptic.com/podcast) Mini Episodes of DS, Machine Learning, and AI.

### Articles & Blogs
These resources are a great way to keep up with what's going on right now in the field.  A few of the sources that I like to browse are:
* [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/)
* [DNuggets](http://www.kdnuggets.com/)
* [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)
* [O'Reilly - Data](https://www.oreilly.com/topics/data)

### Books
I Here's what I am reading now:
  * [Small Data](https://www.amazon.com/Small-DATA-Clues-Uncover-Trends/dp/1522635181) by Martin Lindstom.
    + This was a gift to me from my good friend Sylvie Brick.  Small Data explores the importance of the details we often disregard in a 'big data' focused world
  * [R for Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund
    + Hadley is well known in the R community.  He is the creator of the Tidy Data principles: each column is a variable and each row an observation.  He has created many tools and packages in R to help users create tidy data.  There is also a [PDF version](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
  * [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=RM7YQVRZ75BTFNX33TEP)
    + This is a great resource for technical subjects.  One of my favorite parts is that they include excercises to complete in R.


These are some of the resources that I am using now as I continue to grow in the data science field.  If you have any that you have found to be helpful please feel free to comment below!
