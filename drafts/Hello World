For some strange reason you have fallen upon my website, most likely by accident, but regardless you are here.  First off,
let me start by introducing myself and providing some background.  My name is Logan and a few years ago I began this journey of
realization.  Realization of the power behind data and analysis, behind algorithms and visualizations, and behind art and science.

This awe struck feeling hasn't left me, and I continuously am intrigued by hearing other peoples story and their use of data.
Whether it be through online articles, public forums, email chains or podcasts - I am constantly finding new things to learn about.

Being involved in this community has been one of my goals recently, and what better way than to start my own blog.  For a quick heads
up on what I intend this website to be:  side projects, learning data science,  and anything personal that
i can tie a data spin on will be included.  I look forward to getting this website up and running!
