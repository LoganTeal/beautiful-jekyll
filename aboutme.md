**Work**: Currently, I am a Risk Analyst at [Elevate Credit](www.elevate.com) in Forth Worth, Texas.  Elevate provides online lending solutions to non-prime customers. The company is committed to rewarding borrowersâ€™ good financial behavior with features like interest rates that can go down over time, free financial wellness tools, and free credit monitoring.

**Education**: In 2016 I completed my undergraduate degree at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia where I studied Finance and Business Analytics.  After my undergrad studies, I received my Master's of Analytics from the [Institute for Advanced Analytics at NC State University](http://analytics.ncsu.edu/).

**Hobbies**: Right now I am training for IRONMAN 70.3 in Austin, TX.  I also enjoy exploring Texas, reading, cooking, and learning to play guitar.

**Early Years**:  I was born in Virginia, but North Carolina is home and where I grew up since the age of 6.  I grew up with a love for sports and quickly found the one I connected with the most was swimming. I went on to swim at ODU, where I specialized in the distance freestyle events.  Family is also very important to me, below you can see a picture of them at my Master's graduation in the Fall of 2017.  My parents - Brooks and Mary, and sister Stephanie live back in North Carolina where I love to visit with them throughout the year.
