**Work**: Currently, I am a Risk Analyst at [Elevate Credit](www.elevate.com) in Forth Worth, Texas.  Elevate is a fin-tech company, proving online lending solutions to the under-serviced non prime sector.

**Education**: In 2016 I completed my undergraduate degree at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia where I studied Finance and Business Analytics.  After that I went straight into a Master's of Analytics program at NC State University - [Institute for Advanced Analytics](http://analytics.ncsu.edu/).

**Hobbies**: Right now I am training for IRONMAN 70.3 in Austin, TX.  I also enjoy exploring Texas, reading, cooking, and learning to play guitar.

**Childhood**:  I was born in Virginia, but North Carolina is home and where I grew up since the age of 6.  I grew up spending most of my time playing all types of sports.  Once I was in my teenage years I decided to stick with one - swimming.  I logged quite a few hours in the pool, and went on to swim in college.  Family is also very important to me, below you can see a picture of them at my Masters graduation in the Fall of 2017.  My parents - Brooks and Mary, and sister Stephanie, live back in North Carolina where I love to visit with them throughout the year.
